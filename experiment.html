      Thanks so much for taking my survey! In the experiment, I’ll be asking for your judgments about what kind of freedom some texts exhibit: </p>

  <p>    You could call yourself free if you have the ability to achieve your goals and fulfill your potential. This involves having access to the resources and opportunities that you need in order to develop and grow. </p>

<p>      You could also call yourself free if you aren’t constrained by obstacles or another’s interference. This involves acting without coercion or oppression. </p>

  <p>    This survey will ask you to differentiate between the two, so we’ll label the first of these <strong> opportunity freedom </strong>and the second one <strong>obstacle freedom</strong>. </p>

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>You will be presented with a series of quotations which end mid-sentence. Your first task is to type a few words of what may follow to complete the sentence or phrase. If you come up with several options, choose any that seem natural.
    <p> </p>
      <p> Then, your second task will be to assess whether the resulting text is an example of <strong>opportunity freedom </strong>or <strong>obstacle freedom</strong>. If you believe the phrase to be neither or both types of freedom apply, please select 'Neither or Both". </p>

    <p> Content warning: the texts below are randomly sampled online quotations from 2012. Feel free to skip quotations that may contain language you find objectionable.  </p>
